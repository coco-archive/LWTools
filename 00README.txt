This is LWTOOLS, a cross development system targetting the 6809 CPU.

It consists of an assembler, lwasm, a linker, lwlink, and an archiver,
lwar which should compile on any reasonably modern POSIX environment.

To see if a quick build will work, just type "make". If it works, you're
ready to go ahead with "make install". This will install in /usr/local/bin.

See docs/ for additional information.
