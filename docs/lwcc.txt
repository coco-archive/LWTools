lwcc is based on the PCC compiler code. However, the code has been
substantially modified to elminate autoconf, automake, and support for
targets not supported by lwtools.

In addition, many parts have been substantially rewritten to match the
lwtools code style or generally improve readability.

Some source files are substantially similar to the same files from PCC and
retain the original PCC license. Others, containing original or rewritten
code are licensed under the same license as the rest of lwtools.
