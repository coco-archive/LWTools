These files are extra utility type scripts that can be used for various
purposes.

as

This is a sort of front-end script that makes lwasm look approximately like
gnu as which is useful for using lwasm as a backend to gcc. You will
probably need to edit it to make it work fully. Simply put this in place
of whatever gcc6809 installed for "as" (in the "m6809/bin" folder in
"--prefix") after editing it to point to the real location of the "lwasm"
binary.


ld

Similar to the "as" script above except for lwlink.


ar

Similar to the "as" script above except for lwar.


To use these scripts, you really need to understand how to build a gcc as a
cross compiler. The basics are that you put the as, ld, and ar scripts
whereever you plan to put your cross-development binaries. Then, when
building the cross compiler, you tell it where the scripts are.

The following worked with gcc6809 4.3.4-3:

1. Install the ar, as, and ld scripts named m6809-unknown-{as,ar,ld} in a
directory in your path, say /usr/local/coco/bin/.

2. Make symbolic links to /bin/true for similarly named nm, objdump, ranlib,
and strip in the same directory  Some of these may not be necessary.

3. Unpack gcc and apply the gcc6809 patch.

4. Make sure /usr/local/coco/bin is in your PATH

5. Make sure "." is NOT in your path or is at the END of PATH. If you have
gazillions of errors pop up compiling "gemodes.c", this is your problem.

6. In a directory (other than the gcc source, say "gcc-build" at the same
level as the main gcc directory, do (assuming gcc 4.3.4):

configure --enable-languages=c --target=m6809-unknown \
--program-prefix=m6809-unknown- --enable-obsolete \
--srcdir=../gcc-4.3.4 --disable-threads --disable-nls \
--disable-libssp --prefix=/usr/local/coco \
--with-as=/usr/local/coco/bin/m6809-unknown-as \
--with-ld=/usr/local/coco/bin/m6809-unknown-ld \
--with-ar=/usr/local/coco/bin/m6809-unknown-ar

NOTE: the last three are required to prevent selection of the wrong binutils
programs at runtime.

--with-sysroot might be useful if you have a C library involved.

7. Run "make". If errors appear, troubleshoot.

8. Run "make install". Note that you will have to have your PATH variable
for "root" set up correctly if your install prefix requires root privileges.

The above is WOMM certified. YMMV.
